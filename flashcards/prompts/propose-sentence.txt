I will provide you a pair of word and proposed translation.
Could you provide sentence which tries to reflects proposed meaning?
I will provide it in format:
{
    "1": {"original": "cat", "translated": "kot"},
    "2": {"original": "dog", "translated": "pies"},
    "3": {"original": "to improve", "translated": "ulepszać"}
}
As a response I would expect something like below:
{
    "1": "This is my cat.",
    "2": "Dogs have four paws",
    "3": "I'm trying to improve my code everyday."
}
Sentences should be in English.
Here are words:
{
    "1": {"original": "cat", "translated": "kot"},
    "2": {"original": "dog", "translated": "pies"},
    "3": {"original": "to improve", "translated": "ulepszać"}
}
