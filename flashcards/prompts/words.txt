I would like translate this to Polish.
I would like you to split it into words/phrases.
For each word I would like you to translate it into word in Polish which reflects meaning in sentence.
In case there is the same word with same translation - skip it and not return in response.
I would like this words be in base form present tense, singular (and so on).

The answers to the above can certainly be found, but it comes across that things were added after the fact without really knowing where they are meant to go.

This seems like a case where the architecture wasn’t clear from the beginning and, as the application grew, it became further unclear.

There is no clear separation between what the application does and how it does it.
